# About SyncEvents

SyncEvents is a platform that helps students to know what's happening in the campus and help societies to register students in a more transparent, secure and efficient way using NFTs as tickets. Since NFTs are non fungible, it is unique and can be verified at the time of entrance. This can also help the socities to boost their reach among the students.
This platform provides a one stop place for students to discover events and help socities register them more securely and transpararently. <br>
